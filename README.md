## About 
Launched in 2021, JomMakan is Malaysia's very own e-recipe book, as our authors experiment with 
different ingredients to provide unique recipes from different cuisines to our hungry customers. 
There are two groups of people- those who eat to live, and those that live to eat. 
Here at JomMakan, we're part of the latter as we let our passion for cooking and diverse backgrounds do the talking. 
Our creativity and ability to innovate is unparalleled as we translate our passion into clear and concise recipes.
We work with exceptional talent, both established and emerging chefs, to connect our audience with food on a personal level.
